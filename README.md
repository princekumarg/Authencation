## Key Features

- **User Registration:** Allows users to create new accounts by providing necessary information such as username, email, and password.
- **User Login:** Enables users to log in to their accounts securely using their credentials.
- **Password Hashing:** Utilizes hashing algorithms like bcrypt to securely store and verify passwords, enhancing user data protection.
- **Middleware Integration:** Integrates authentication middleware to protect routes and restrict access to authenticated users only.
- **Session Management:** Manages user sessions and provides features like session expiration and logout functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **Express.js:** A minimalist web framework for Node.js, providing robust features for building web applications.
- **bcrypt:** A library for hashing passwords securely, enhancing password protection.
- **Session Management Libraries:** (Optional) Libraries like express-session for managing user sessions.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Configure environment variables for database connection and JWT secret.
4. Run the application using `npm start`.

## Usage

1. Register a new user account using the provided registration endpoint.
2. Log in to the application using your registered credentials.
3. Access protected routes that require authentication, such as user profile or dashboard pages.
4. Log out from the application to end the session securely.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with third-party authentication providers like OAuth for social login options.
- Implementation of role-based access control (RBAC) for defining user roles and permissions.
- Enhancements to password recovery and reset functionalities.
